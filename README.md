# Problem Definition
Farmers face significant economic losses and crop waste due to various
diseases affecting potato plants. By employing deep learning and image
classification, we aim to create a practical and reliable tool that can accurately
identify the presence of diseases in potato plants, focusing specifically on the
available dataset containing potato disease images. Early detection of diseases will
empower farmers to implement appropriate interventions, optimize resource
allocation, and make informed decisions to mitigate the spread of diseases, minimize
crop losses, and increase crop yield.

# Explanation of The Neural Network Model Used
For this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was employed for the task of potato disease detection.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village?resource=download)

- We run this test on google colabrotary. 
- We trained our model in 'training.ipynb' and save as '1'.
- '1' named folder contains our saved_model.
- 'PlantVillage' is our test dataset and contains 102 samples.
- We loaded 'PlantVillage' and '1' folder into colab. 
- After loading 'PlantVillage' and '1' into colab with 'PlantDiseasesTest.ipynb', you can use our code.
